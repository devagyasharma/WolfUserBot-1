## What is it?

WolfUserBot is a modular Telegram userbot running on Python3, which can be coupled up with Heroku.

WolfUserBot is currently maintained by [Rajveer](https://t.me/Smart_S54) [œª Ä ùó¶·¥Ä·¥ç·¥ç è‚îÉW·¥è üÍú∞G·¥Ä…¥…¢‚îÉ üê∫ ](https://t.me/Mr_Semmy). It started as a simple bot,

which helped with group management, [WolfUserBot](https://github.com/WolfGangIndia/WolfUserBot).

It has since evolved, becoming extremely modular and simple to use.

**Heroku Configuration**
Simply just leave the Config as it is.

## Mandatory Vars

- Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.
- This is because of `telethon.errors.rpc_error_list.ApiIdPublishedFloodError`

    - `APP_ID`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    - `API_HASH`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org

- The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.

```python3
from sample_config import Config
class Development(Config):
  APP_ID = 6
  API_HASH = "3eeb1aeb98ae0f581eeb06d4abfb49dc"
  TG_BOT_TOKEN_BF_HER = ""
  TG_BOT_USER_NAME_BF_HER = ""
  UB_BLACK_LIST_CHAT = []
  # specify LOAD and NO_LOAD
  LOAD = []
  NO_LOAD = []
```
